How the session system is going to work for the webserver.


Simple idea:

The NodeJS webserver requests a key from a C# back-end program, the application creates a random session key and stores the key in the database. 
The NodeJS webserver sends the session key to the browser and saves it in a cookie. 

If a client connects to the webserver, the webserver checks if a session already exists. 
If so:
  ...

Else:
  Create a session key for the client. (See above)
