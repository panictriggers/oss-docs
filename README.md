<h2>General idea</h2>
We will be building an open-source, free-to-use School Management System under the name <b>Open School System (OSS)</b>. The name might be changed in the future though.

It's proposed features:
- School scheduling
- Attendance System
- Grade input
- File Server
- Built-in end-to-end chat messaging with students, teachers and staff. (Based on Signal Protocol)
- Easy admin tools
